# Train-Scheduler

## Overview

Flinders Street Station Train Schedule was created for the Train Scheduler homework assignment for Berkeley Coding Bootcamp and incorporate Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Requirements

- When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    * Train name
    * Destination
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
- Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive: this should be relative to the current time.
- Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
